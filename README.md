*  Import and clean data (e.g., remove nulls, format dates, standardize fields like vehicle types and payment methods).
*  Create relationships between tables, and add calculated columns such as Ride Status, On-Time flags using V_TAT and C_TAT.
*  Build KPIs like Total Bookings, Revenue, Cancelled Rides, Avg Ratings using DAX formulas for insights.
*  Use KPI cards, bar/line charts, pie charts, and maps. Add slicers for filters like date, location, or vehicle type.
*  Test dashboard interactivity, validate metrics, schedule refreshes, and publish it to Power BI Service or SharePoint.
