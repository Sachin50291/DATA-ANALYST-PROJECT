# OLA-DATA-ANALYSIS(Interactive dashboard using MS POWER BI)
## Project Objective
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for Ola ride bookings that provides actionable insights into ride performance, cancellations, and customer behavior. The dashboard visualizes key metrics like booking trends, payment methods, and ratings. It supports data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
## Data Set used
-<a href="https://gofile.io/d/GmNlYo"> Ola Dashboard Data <a/>
## Questions (KPIs)
*  How many rides were canceled by customers vs. drivers?
*  What is the average ride distance per booking?
*  What is the total revenue generated from all completed rides?
*  What is the average driver and customer rating?
*  What percentage of rides were completed on time (based on V_TAT and C_TAT)?
*  What is the peak booking time (hour of day or day of week)?
*  Which customers have the highest number of cancellations?
*  What are the most common reasons for incomplete rides?
*  What is the customer satisfaction score trend over time?
## Dashboard

## Process
*  Import and clean data (e.g., remove nulls, format dates, standardize fields like vehicle types and payment methods).
*  Create relationships between tables, and add calculated columns such as Ride Status, On-Time flags using V_TAT and C_TAT.
*  Build KPIs like Total Bookings, Revenue, Cancelled Rides, Avg Ratings using DAX formulas for insights.
*  Use KPI cards, bar/line charts, pie charts, and maps. Add slicers for filters like date, location, or vehicle type.
*  Test dashboard interactivity, validate metrics, schedule refreshes, and publish it to Power BI Service or SharePoint.

## Project Insights
*  High cancellation rates by customers during peak hours suggest potential delays or pricing issues.
*  Sedans are the most preferred vehicle type, followed by hatchbacks, indicating customer preference for comfort.
*  Digital payments dominate over cash, showing a strong shift toward cashless transactions.
*  On-time performance drops significantly in specific locations, pointing to traffic bottlenecks or driver availability.
*  Average customer rating remains high, but some drivers receive consistently low ratings and need review.
## Final Conclusion:
The dashboard provides actionable insights into booking trends, cancellations, and ride performance.
It helps identify operational bottlenecks and customer behavior patterns for better decision-making.
Overall, it empowers stakeholders to enhance service efficiency and improve customer satisfaction.
